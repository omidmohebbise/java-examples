In Java, the ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe implementation of the Map interface. It allows multiple threads to read and write data simultaneously, without the need for locking the entire map. Unlike a regular HashMap, which is not thread-safe, ConcurrentHashMap ensures that the operations are thread-safe, making it ideal for scenarios where multiple threads need to access and modify the map concurrently.

- Provides thread-safe operations without locking the entire map.
- Allows multiple threads to operate concurrently by dividing the map into segments.
- Supports atomic operations like putIfAbsent(), replace() and remove()
- The default concurrency level of ConcurrentHashMap is 16
- Inserting null objects is not possible in ConcurrentHashMap as a key or value.



**Constructors**

 - **Concurrency-Level:**
It is the number of threads concurrently updating the map. The implementation performs internal sizing to try to accommodate this many threads.
 - **Load-Factor:** 
Itâ€™s a threshold, used to control resizing.

 - **Initial Capacity:** 
Accommodation of a certain number of elements initially provided by the implementation. if the capacity of this map is 10. It means that it can store 10 entries.

**Segment:**

The map was internally divided into multiple segments (like mini hash tables). Each segment had its own lock, allowing multiple threads to access different segments concurrently without blocking each other.

**Block:** 

This usually refers to the locking mechanism. When a thread writes to a segment, it acquires a lock (blocks) for that segment, preventing other threads from writing to the same segment at the same time.
