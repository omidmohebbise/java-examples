## The most common solutions for avoiding data races in Java

It involve ensuring that shared resources (variables, objects, etc.) are accessed by only one thread at a time, or ensuring atomicity in the operations performed on those resources.

### Synchronized Keyword

The synchronized keyword ensures that only one thread can execute a block of code or a method that operates on shared data at a time. This prevents concurrent modification of shared resources.

**Advantages:** Simple and effective in preventing data races.

**Disadvantages:** Can cause performance bottlenecks because it prevents multiple threads from accessing the synchronized code at the same time.

### Explicit Locks (ReentrantLock)

The ReentrantLock class in java.util.concurrent.locks provides more flexible thread synchronization compared to synchronized. You can acquire and release locks explicitly, with additional features like try-lock and fairness.

**Advantages:** More control over locking, can be non-blocking if tryLock is used.

**Disadvantages:** Slightly more complex than synchronized, and you must remember to unlock in a finally block to avoid deadlocks.

### Atomic Variables (AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, etc.)
The java.util.concurrent.atomic package provides atomic classes like AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicReference, etc. These classes perform atomic operations without needing explicit synchronization.

**Advantages:** Non-blocking and very efficient for single atomic operations like increment, decrement, and get.

**Disadvantages:** Not suitable for complex operations requiring multiple atomic steps.


### Thread-safe Collections
Java provides several thread-safe collection classes, such as ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, and BlockingQueue. These collections are designed to handle concurrency efficiently without the need for explicit locking.

**Advantages:** Simplifies handling of shared data when collections are used.

**Disadvantages:** These collections use internal synchronization mechanisms, which can sometimes lead to overhead depending on the scenario.

### Immutable Objects

**Advantages:** Thread safety is guaranteed since there is no possibility of modifying shared state.

**Disadvantages:** Requires creating new objects for every modification, which may cause performance concerns in some cases.

### ThreadLocal Variables
The ThreadLocal class allows each thread to have its own local copy of a variable. This avoids race conditions by isolating variables to individual threads.

**Advantages:** Each thread has its own variable, so there's no shared state to worry about.
**Disadvantages:** Canâ€™t be used when threads need to share data.

### Locks for Multiple Threads (ReadWriteLock)
ReadWriteLock allows multiple threads to read a resource concurrently, but only one thread can write at a time. This is useful when you have more reads than writes.


**Advantages:** Improves performance when there are more read operations than write operations.
**Disadvantages:** Slightly more complex, and overhead from managing read and write locks.
